EXERCISE: The code in this Project is operational, but it is completed to a very poor standard. Your company's Quality Control arm would like you to refactor the code to the company's stringent quality standards.

Explanation:
A client's business sells cameras, phones and sunglasses. Their database is a mess but you have access to their various product listings. The goal is to consolidate all of the client's products into a single list so that they can be sorted and displayed on the app.

You must provide access to all of the same information, but you can change the functions as much as you like.

Your company values the following coding standards:
 - Maintainability
 - Readability
 - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
 - SOLID design principles

Please pay special attention to SOLID design principles. Research the concept well before starting, as it's weighted heavily in our evaluation criteria. Refactor this project to the best of your ability. You can write whatever extra classes that may be necessary to tidy up. You may also modify the function definitions in ProductDataConsolidator.

 You do not need to update the UI to make it look prettier.

Please also provide evidence that you have tested that your changes all work correctly.

If you are invited to an interview, you may be asked to explain in depth how you refactored this project and why.
